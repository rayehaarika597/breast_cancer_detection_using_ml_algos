***Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms***

Machine learning is widely used in bio informatics and particularly in breast cancer diagnosis. In this project, we have used certain classification methods such as K-nearest neighbors (K-NN),Support Vector Machine (SVM),Logistic Regression(LR) and Random Forest(RF) which is a supervised learning methods to detect breast cancer. Cancer diagnosis is one of the most studied problems in the medical domain. Several researchers have focused in order to improve performance and achieved to obtain satisfactory results. Early detection of cancer is essential for a rapid response and better chances of cure. Unfortunately, early detection of cancer is often difﬁcult because the symptoms of the disease at the beginning are absent. Thus, it is necessary to discover and interpret new knowledge to prevent and minimize the risk adverse consequences.

To understand this problem more precisely, tools are needed to help oncologists to choose the treatment required for healing or prevention of recurrence by reducing the harmful effects of certain treatments and their costs. In artiﬁcial intelligent, machine learning is a discipline which allows the machine to evolve through a process. Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset obtained by the university of Wisconsin Hospital is used to classify tumors as benign or malignant.



**The analysis is divided into four sections**

-Identifying the problem and Data Sources

-Exploratory Data Analysis

-Pre-Processing the Data

-Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign



**k- Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classification technique**

k-NN is a non- parametric method used for classification. In this classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. It is the simplest algorithm among all the machine learning algorithms.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification Technique**

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well

**Logistic Regression**

Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable.

**Random Forest Algorithm**

Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.

Among these four algorithms, **Random forest algorithm** gives the highest accuracy of **99.7%**.
