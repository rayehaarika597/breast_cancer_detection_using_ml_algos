***Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms***

In bioinformatics, machine learning is frequently employed, particularly in the diagnosis of breast cancer. In this work, supervised learning techniques for detecting breast cancer, such as K-nearest neighbours (K-NN) and support vector machines (SVM), are applied.
